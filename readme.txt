# Auto NPC

Reproduce a character sheet for the role-playing game Legend of the Five Rings.
The goal is to automatically generate the name, background, personality, and appearance of an NPC.

For now, only the family, schools, advantages, and disadvantages are generated. I need to add the rings, traits, and skills.
But I also need to modify the prompt to make it more varied, and there are still bugs to fix.
